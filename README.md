# Customer Portal Application

This project is a responsive and interactive customer portal application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application fetches and displays customer data from an external API, providing users with a dynamic interface to browse customer details. It features a detailed customer information section, lazy-loaded customer list, and a photo gallery with placeholder images while loading.

## Features

- **Data Fetching from API**: Fetches customer data from an external API and maps it to a structured format, including randomly assigned titles.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implements lazy loading for the customer list, displaying an infinite scroll of customer cards with the ability to load more data as the user scrolls.
- **Detailed Customer View**: Displays detailed information about selected customers, including name, title, address, contact details, and a photo gallery.
- **Photo Gallery**: Dynamically loads and displays photos related to the selected customer, with placeholder images shown during loading.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error handling with user-friendly messages in case of data fetching issues.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety to the codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Loader Spinner**: Used for displaying loading animations during data fetching.
- **Picsum.photos**: Provides placeholder images for the photo gallery.
